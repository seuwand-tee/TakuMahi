<h3> MDN Docs </h3>
My favorite documentation for doing nay front-end work.
Contains stuff from javascript, css and html.

<h3> Bootstrap </h3>
<p>The documention for using any bootstrap. The below link has
the tags you can go and paste into the page to link in the css/js files.
adress: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/
<p><i>Note: Make sure that you put the css inside the heading before
Any other css files are linked. The javascript link needs to go inside the end
of the body tag and before any custom javascript files are linked.Doing 
Things this way means your css and html will load in before the js runs
preventing some annoying bugs and keeping thigns consistent</i></p>


<h3> Changing positions </h3>
<p> The following page was super helpful when I was first learning how to control
how elements appeared and I would consider it a must read if making any web pages.

<h3> Copying the calander from view calander html page </h3>
<p> To do this you will need to scroll through the html And find the view you want to copy.
 You should also take the relavant js and whatever css you need. Also you need the bootstrap 
 links as above.</p>
